# Scala-Parallel-Programming

This repo contains my weekly notes for coursera [Parallel Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1) course offered by Viktor Kuncak and Aleksandar Prokopec.

I am using [jupyter-notebook with scala 2.10 kernel](https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala) to generate the notebooks!

## NOTE:

Please see the notebooks in [Nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for better display in the following links:
