# Scala-Parallel-Programming

This repo contains my weekly notes for coursera [Parallel Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1) course offered by [Viktor Kuncak](http://lara.epfl.ch/~kuncak/) and [Aleksandar Prokopec](http://axel22.github.io/).

Some useful code snippets of the course released by Aleksandar Prokopec is available [here](https://github.com/axel22/parprog-snippets).

[Jupyter-notebook with scala 2.10 kernel](https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala) is used to generate the notebooks!
